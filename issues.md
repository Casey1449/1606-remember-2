  When the user visits the root of the application (e.g. the "/" URL), they should see a list of all of the reminders on the page.
  Each reminder should have a class of .spec-reminder-item.
  There is a failing test set up in tests/acceptance/reminder-list-test.js.

  Hot Tip: If you name your pull request or even your commit with "Closes #1", it will automatically close this issue when it successfully merged into master.
